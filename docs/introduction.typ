- Building a peer-to-peer network (in Rust) at *Dria*#footnote([formerly known as *FirstBatch*]).
- Interested in EVM & Solidity, and all kinds of languages!
- Loves open-source, contributed to a few zero-knowledge cryptography & LLM libraries.
- Worked on GPU programming (CUDA) at Ko√ß University.
- Using Rust for \~2 years, can't go back to *anything else*.
- See more at *erhant.me*#footnote([note to self: rewrite with `ratzilla`]) or `github.com/erhant`.
- This presentation is written in *Typst*, a typesetting language built in Rust!

== What is libp2p?

libp2p#footnote("https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p") is a modular peer-to-peer networking stack, driven by well-designed specifications with several implementations (Go, JavaScript, *Rust*, C).

Rust implementation of libp2p in particular is being used in notable projects like *IPFS* client, *Lighthouse* Ethereum consensus client, *Filecoin* client, *Substrate* (of Polkadot), and many more.
